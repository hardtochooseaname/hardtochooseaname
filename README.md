### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a master's student in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
My major is Computer Technology and I'm studying distributed system and network.
The program language I use is Cpp and C, I'm also learning Go lang.

I created this profile README because of the request of GitHub for education program. 
I think that's enough?
